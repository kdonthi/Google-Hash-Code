# Google-Hash-Code
Hi, my name is Kaushik Donthi and this is my take on Google's Hash Code problem for 2020. Clone it, compile it using 

gcc -o hashcode hashcode.c

and run it using a .txt file with the specified input.

./hashcode ___TXTFILE___

If you just want to look, go to hashcode.c. Any suggestions for improvement are welcomed!
