# Google Hash Code '20
Hi, my name is Kaushik Donthi and this is my take on Google's Hash Code problem for 2020. Clone it, compile it using 

gcc -o hashcode hashcode.c

and run it using a .in file with the input in the format specified by the problem statement. 

./hashcode ___INPUTFILE___

I have given two .in files for testing.

If you just want to look at the code, go to hashcode.c. If you want to look at the problem statement, go to problemstatement.c. Any suggestions for improvement are welcomed.
