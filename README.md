# Google-Hash-Code
Hi, my name is Kaushik Donthi and this is my take on Google's Hash Code problem for 2020. Clone it, compile it using 

gcc -o hashcode hashcode.c

and run it using a .txt file with the specified input.

./hashcode ___TXTFILE___

If you just want to look at the code, go to hashcode.c. If you want to look at the problem statement, go to problemstatement.c - pretty self explanatory :) Any suggestions for improvement are welcomed.
